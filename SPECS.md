Trippando - Project Specifications

## Project Overview
Trippando is a mobile-first Progressive Web App (PWA) designed for tracking travel expenses and managing notes during a trip. The primary goal is to provide a Native iOS Feel without being a native app. The app must allow the user to record expenses (maybe with currency conversion, if API exists), track who paid, and access critical travel notes.
